This is my first Flutter UI screen designed as a personal profile page. The screen features a clean and minimal layout with a calming teal background, a circular profile image at the center, and clearly presented personal details. It highlights my name and role as a Flutter Developer, followed by neatly styled contact cards for phone number and email address.

The UI focuses on simplicity, readability, and visual balance, using Flutter widgets such as Column, CircleAvatar, Container, and custom styling to create a modern and professional look. This page serves as a foundational step in my Flutter journey, showcasing my understanding of layout structuring, styling, and responsive design principles.
